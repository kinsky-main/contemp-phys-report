  abstract = {Executive Summary
              For four decades semiconductor electronics has followed Moore's law: with each generation of integration the circuit features became smaller, more complex and faster. This development is now reaching a wall so that smaller is no longer any faster. The clock rate has saturated at about 3-5GHz and the parallel processor approach will soon reach its limit. The prime reason for the limitation the semiconductor electronics experiences is not the switching speed of the individual transistor, but its power dissipation and thus heat. Digital superconductive electronics is a circuit- and device-technology that is inherently faster at much less power dissipation than semiconductor electronics. It makes use of superconductors and Josephson junctions as circuit elements, which can provide extremely fast digital devices in a frequency range - dependent on the material - of hundreds of GHz: for example a flip-flop has been demonstrated that operated at 750GHz. This digital technique is scalable and follows similar design rules as semiconductor devices. Its very low power dissipation of only 0.1μW per gate at 100GHz opens the possibility of three-dimensional integration. Circuits like microprocessors and analogue-to-digital converters for commercial and military applications have been demonstrated. In contrast to semiconductor circuits, the operation of superconducting circuits is based on naturally standardized digital pulses the area of which is exactly the flux quantum Φ0. The flux quantum is also the natural quantization unit for digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters. The latter application is so precise, that it is being used as voltage standard and that the physical unit 'Volt' is defined by means of this standard. Apart from its outstanding features for digital electronics, superconductive electronics provides also the most sensitive sensor for magnetic fields: the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). Amongst many other applications SQUIDs are used as sensors for magnetic heart and brain signals in medical applications, as sensor for geological surveying and food-processing and for non-destructive testing. As amplifiers of electrical signals, SQUIDs can nearly reach the theoretical limit given by Quantum Mechanics. A further important field of application is the detection of very weak signals by 'transition-edge' bolometers, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and superconductive tunnel junctions. Their application as radiation detectors in a wide frequency range, from microwaves to X-rays is now standard. The very low losses of superconductors have led to commercial microwave filter designs that are now widely used in the USA in base stations for cellular phones and in military communication applications. The number of demonstrated applications is continuously increasing and there is no area in professional electronics, in which superconductive electronics cannot be applied and surpasses the performance of classical devices. Superconductive electronics has to be cooled to very low temperatures. Whereas this was a bottleneck in the past, cooling techniques have made a huge step forward in recent years: very compact systems with high reliability and a wide range of cooling power are available commercially, from microcoolers of match-box size with milli-Watt cooling power to high-reliability coolers of many Watts of cooling power for satellite applications. Superconductive electronics will not replace semiconductor electronics and similar room-temperature techniques in standard applications, but for those applications which require very high speed, low-power consumption, extreme sensitivity or extremely high precision, superconductive electronics is superior to all other available techniques. To strengthen the European competitiveness in superconductor electronics research projects have to be set-up in the following field:-Ultra-sensitive sensing and imaging.-Quantum measurement instrumentation.-Advanced analogue-to-digital converters.-Superconductive electronics technology.}

  abstract  = {The book covers three main strands, Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), superfluid and superconductivity. The subjects are developed in a way which gradually builds up the key concepts and the necessary mathematical machinery. The book begins with the simplest of the three topics, BEC, and first thoroughly reviews the basics of the Bose-Einstein ideal gas before going into the techniques of magnetic trapping and cooling of atoms and the discovery of BEC in dilute atomic gases. Superfluidity in helium-4 is more difficult to understand, because it is a strongly interacting quantum liquid. The book introduces the main physical phenomena of superfluidity, and how it follows from the key concept of macroscopic quantum coherence and off-diagonal long ranged order. The theory of superconductivity is developed in stages, starting with the simpler London and Ginzburg Landau theories and their main applications, before developing the mathematical concepts of a quantum coherent state and the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The final chapter deals with the more advanced topics, including superfluid helium-3 and evidence for unconventional Cooper pairing in exotic superconductors. No prior knowledge of quantum many-body theory is assumed, and the necessary mathematical concepts are introduced in a self-contained manner where needed.},

  abstract = {Two optimization technologies, namely, bypass and carry-control optimization, were demonstrated for enhancing the performance of a bit-slice Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in 2n-bit Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) microprocessors. These technologies can not only shorten the calculation time but also solve data hazards. Among them, the proposed bypass technology is applicable to any 2n-bit ALU, whether it is bit-serial, bit-slice or bit-parallel. The high performance bit-slice ALU was implemented using the 6 kA/cm2 Nb/AlOx/Nb junction fabrication process from Superconducting Electronics Facility of Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology. It consists of 1693 Josephson junctions with an area of 2.46 × 0.81 mm2. All ALU operations of the MIPS32 instruction set are implemented, including two extended instructions, i.e., addition with carry (ADDC) and subtraction with borrow (SUBB). All the ALU operations were successfully obtained in SFQ testing based on OCTOPUX and the measured DC bias current margin can reach 86% - 104%. The ALU achieves a 100% utilization rate, regardless of carry/borrow read-after-write correlations between instructions.}

  abstract = { Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) logic, based on the representation of digital bits by single quanta of magnetic flux in superconducting loops, may combine several-hundred-GHz speed with extremely low power dissipation (close to 10-18 Joule/bit) and very simple fabrication technology. The drawbacks of this technology include the necessity of deep (liquid-helium-level) cooling of RSFQ circuits and the rudimentary level of the currently available fabrication and testing facilities. The objective of this paper is to review RSFQ device physics and also discuss in brief the prospects of future development of this technology in the light of the tradeoff between its advantages and handicaps. }
